# Project 2: Custom Java Application  

## Project Validation  
Before starting, you must **validate your project idea** with the instructor.  

### Project Requirements  
Your project must include a **user-facing interface** through the command line. If you find the project overwhelming, focus on building the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** first.  

### Mandatory Features  
Your project must incorporate the following:  
- **Abstract classes or interfaces**  --> interfaces not done
- **5 unit tests**  ---> not yet done
- **Functional programming techniques** (e.g., `streams`, `map`, `filter`)  ----> moderately done
- **At least one third-party package** (excluding JUnit)  ----> make use of object mapper and jackson
- **Optimized time complexity** (consider **Big O Notation** where applicable)  
- **Built using either Maven or Gradle**  ---> MAVEN USED

### Nice-to-Have Features  
These features are optional but will enhance your project:  
- **Reading and writing to a file** (for data persistence)  --->not done
- **Logging**  ---> not done
- **Additional unit tests**  
- **Integration with a third-party API**  
- **Multi-dimensional arrays**  
- **Additional validation**  
- **User roles** (e.g., Admin, Normal User)  
- **Additional testing and mocking** (if applicable)  

## Project Planning  
Once your idea is validated, start **planning your project steps**:  
1. **Break down features into tasks**  
2. **Use a project management tool** (e.g., **Trello**) to track tasks  
3. **Prioritize the MVP** and build iteratively  

## Timeline  
- **Project Duration:** 2 weeks  
- **Project Presentations:** **20/02/2025** (Attendance is mandatory)  

## Additional Notes  
- Expect **daily standups** to track progress  
- There will be **small lessons** on some days to supplement your learning  

Good luck, and Happy Coding! ðŸš€
